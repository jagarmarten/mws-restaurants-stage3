# Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course - stage 3

## Project Overview: Stage 3

In this stage I had to add 2 things to the application:
    1. Adding a favorite button to the restaurants - user is able to favorite his/her restaurant
    2. Adding a form for users to submit their own restaurant review
All of the new functionalities had to be created **offline first** - the form works even when offline as well as does the button.
